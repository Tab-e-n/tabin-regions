# Tabin's Regions

A very simple singleplayer / local multiplayer game where you control colored regions and capture opposing regions, similar to Risk.
Controled by the mouse, with a few optional keyboard shortcuts. 

Might make a small tutorial here on how to make a map, since it is not a hard process once you do it once.

Not yet finished, it is lacking maps, and a it is missing a harder AI opponent.

Developed with Godot 4.0.4.
