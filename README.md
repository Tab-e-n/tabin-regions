# Regions

A very simple multiplayer game where you control colored regions and capture opposing regions, similar to Risk.
Controlled by the mouse, with a few optional keyboard shortcuts. 

Can be pretty easily expanded if you bother with understanding my code :P. Might make a small tutorial here on how to make a map, since it is not hard once you understand it.

Not yet finished, it is missing maps and harder computer opponents.
